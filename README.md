# Random-Matrix-theory-for-pedestrians

This reposiroty contains notebooks and code to complement a series of blog articles on Random Matrix theory and Random systems in general, that I am writing on Medium's Cantor's Paradise; I am grateful to the editors of CP to give me the opportunity to contribute to their great science focus publications. 

The code has been written in Python for easy of use and also becasue this is so far the most common language in the Data Science/Machine Learning community. Any comment and contribution is welcome. The table of contents below contains links to the original articles:
