# Random-Matrix-theory-for-pedestrians

This reposiroty contains notebooks and code to complement a series of blog articles on Random Matrix theory and Random systems in general, that I am writing here. 
The code has been written in Python for easy of use and also becasue this is so far the most common language in the Data Science/Machine Learning community. Any comment and contribution is welcome.
